            <h1>Nostria Successfully Completes $30,000 Pre-Seed Funding Round Using Angor Protocol</h1>
            <h2 class="press-subtitle">
                Decentralized Social Network Client Raises Funds to Scale Nostr Protocol Infrastructure
            </h2>

            <div class="press-body">
                <p class="lead">
                    <strong>Nostria</strong>, the innovative Nostr protocol client designed for global scale, today
                    announced the successful completion of its $30,000 pre-seed funding round. The campaign, which ran
                    from May 12-31, 2025, utilized the groundbreaking Angor peer-to-peer funding protocol built on
                    Bitcoin, marking a significant milestone in decentralized fundraising for decentralized social
                    infrastructure.
                </p>

                <h3>Revolutionary Funding Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    The funding round represents a first-of-its-kind achievement in the Nostr ecosystem, combining
                    decentralized social networking with decentralized funding mechanisms. By utilizing the Angor
                    protocol, Nostria demonstrated its commitment to decentralization at every level of its operations,
                    from the social network itself to how the company raises capital.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "This successful funding round validates not only the demand for better Nostr infrastructure but
                    also the viability of truly decentralized funding mechanisms," said <strong>Sondre Bjellås</strong>,
                    Founder and CEO of Nostria. "We're proving that you can build decentralized companies using
                    decentralized tools, creating a more aligned and transparent relationship with our investors and
                    users."
                </p>

                <h3>Heartfelt Gratitude to Our Investors</h3>
                <div class="thank-you-section">

                        <strong>Thank you for taking this journey with us. Together, we're building something truly
                            special.</strong>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Committed to Delivery</h3>
                <p>
                    The three-month development period begins immediately, with funds allocated across three critical
                    milestones:
                </p>

                <ul class="milestone-list">
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure Setup (€10,000):</strong> Deploying global relay network and media
                        servers to support the Nostria app while continuing core development</li>
                    <li><strong>Core Feature Development (€10,000):</strong> Enhancing premium features and improving
                        multi-platform support</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing & Growth (€10,000):</strong> User acquisition, community building, and
                        preparing for the upcoming Seed Round</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We have already begun work on many features on Nostria, and our team is fully committed to
                    delivering the high-quality MVP we've promised.
                </p>

                <h3>Building the Future of Social Communication</h3>
                <p>
                    Nostria addresses a critical challenge in the Nostr ecosystem: making decentralized social
                    networking as easy and reliable as traditional platforms while maintaining true decentralization.
                    Nostria's architecture distributes users across appropriate relays, creating a more resilient and
                    faster network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The platform already serves thousands of users across web, desktop, and mobile platforms, with
                    premium features including dedicated relays, media hosting, verified usernames, and automated backup
                    services.
                </p>

                <h3>Competing with Centralized Social Media, Not Other Nostr Apps</h3>
                <p>
                    Nostria's mission is not to compete with other Nostr clients, but
                    to provide a compelling alternative to centralized social media platforms like X, Facebook, and
                    Bluesky. The goal is to make Nostr so user-friendly and feature-rich that mainstream users will
                    choose it over traditional platforms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "We see other Nostr clients as allies in a shared mission to decentralize social media," explained
                    <strong>Sondre Bjellås</strong>. "Our real competition is the centralized platforms that control
                    billions of users' data and conversations. We're building Nostria to be the bridge that brings
                    mainstream users into the decentralized world, working alongside other clients to grow the entire
                    Nostr ecosystem."
                </p>

                <p>
                    This collaborative approach extends to Nostria's development philosophy, where improvements to the
                    underlying Nostr protocol benefit all clients, creating a rising tide that lifts all boats in the
                    decentralized social networking space.
                </p>

                <h3>What's Next</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the next three months, the Nostria team will focus on delivering key infrastructure
                    improvements and feature enhancements that will position the platform for its upcoming Seed Round.
                    Pre-seed investors will receive SAFE agreements with a 15% discount rate and pro-rata rights for
                    future funding rounds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "This is just the beginning," added <strong>Sondre Bjellås</strong>.
                    "We're building infrastructure that will support millions of users while staying true to the
                    decentralized principles that make Nostr special. Our investors are getting in early on what we
                    believe will become a great social media platform."
                </p>

                <h3>A Transparent, Milestone-Based Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    The use of the Angor protocol ensures complete transparency in fund deployment, with releases tied
                    to verified development milestones. This approach aligns perfectly with Nostria's commitment to open
                    development and community accountability.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All investors will receive monthly progress reports, with higher-tier investors gaining access to
                    quarterly calls with the founding team. This level of transparency reflects Nostria's commitment to
                    building not just a great product, but a trustworthy relationship with its stakeholder community.
