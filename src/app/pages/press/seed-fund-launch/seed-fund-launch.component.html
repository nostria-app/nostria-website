        <p class="lead">
          <strong>October 6, 2025</strong> – Nostria, the next-generation Nostr client platform, today announced the launch of its $400,000 seed funding round using a Revenue-Based Financing (RBF) structure recorded on the Angor protocol. This innovative approach allows investors to participate directly in Nostria's premium subscription revenue through Bitcoin-settled monthly distributions, without taking equity or issuing tokens.

      <!-- Key Details -->
      <section class="press-section">
        <h2>Revolutionary Funding Model</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional venture capital or token offerings, Nostria's RBF structure provides investors with a transparent, formula-driven share of the company's subscription revenue. Contributors receive 50% of net premium subscription revenue, distributed monthly in Bitcoin based on their weighted contribution percentage.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We're pioneering a new way to fund decentralized social infrastructure," said Sondre Bjellås, CEO of Nostria. "By using the Angor protocol to record contributions and automate distributions, we're creating a fully transparent funding mechanism that aligns investor interests with our long-term success—without diluting ownership or creating speculative token dynamics."
