                <h3>The Beginning has Started</h3>
                <p>
                    "The Beginning has Started" represents more than just a product launch—it signifies the start of
                    Nostria's mission to bring decentralized social networking to the masses. After months of open
                    development where anyone was free to test and provide feedback, Nostria now stands as a complete,
                    production-ready platform ready to serve users worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Today marks a crucial milestone in our journey," said <strong>Sondre Bjellås</strong>,
                    Founder and CEO of Nostria. "We're not just launching a product—we're beginning our mission to
                    reach one million daily active users and prove that decentralized social media can compete with
                    and surpass traditional platforms. This is only the beginning."
                </p>

                <h3>Built in the Open, Ready for Scale</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional tech companies that develop behind closed doors, Nostria has been built
                    transparently in the public eye. This open development approach has allowed the community to
                    contribute feedback, test features, and help shape the platform throughout its development cycle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The MVP represents a stable foundation with full backwards compatibility guarantees, ensuring that
                    users and developers can build upon Nostria with confidence. The platform will continue to evolve
                    with daily updates and improvements, maintaining the rapid development pace that has characterized
                    the project since its inception.
                </p>

                <h3>Premium Features Powered by Bitcoin Lightning</h3>
                <p>
                    Nostria Premium is now available, featuring Bitcoin Lightning Network integration for seamless,
                    instant payments. Premium subscribers gain access to enhanced features including dedicated relays,
                    premium media hosting, verified usernames, and advanced backup services—all designed to provide
                    enterprise-grade reliability while maintaining decentralization principles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "We believe in providing value at every tier," explained <strong>Sondre Bjellås</strong>.
                    "Our free tier offers a complete social networking experience, while Premium users get the
                    infrastructure and features needed for professional use. The Lightning integration makes subscribing
                    as simple as scanning a QR code."
                </p>

                <h3>Ambitious Goals: One Million Daily Active Users</h3>
                <p>
                    Nostria is being developed with mass adoption in mind. The platform's goal is ambitious but
                    achievable: reaching one million daily active users by focusing relentlessly on user experience,
                    performance, and feature completeness that rivals centralized alternatives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The platform's architecture is designed to scale globally while maintaining the decentralized
                    principles that make Nostr special. By distributing users across appropriate relays and providing
                    premium infrastructure options, Nostria creates a faster, more reliable network that can support
                    mainstream adoption.
                </p>

                <h3>Getting Started is Simple</h3>
                <p>
                    One of Nostria's key advantages is how quickly new users can get started. The onboarding process
                    has been designed to be intuitive and welcoming, removing the technical barriers that have
                    traditionally made decentralized social networks intimidating for mainstream users.

                <p>
                    The video demonstrates Nostria's commitment to user experience, showing how new users can join
                    the decentralized social network without needing technical knowledge about relays, cryptographic
                    keys, or blockchain technology. This ease of use is crucial for achieving the goal of one million
                    daily active users.

                    <p>
                        Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a decentralized social networking
                        protocol that enables censorship-resistant communication and social interaction. Unlike
