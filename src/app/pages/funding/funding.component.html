    </div>

    <div class="faq-grid">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are Convertible Notes?</h3>
        <p>
          Convertible Notes are a form of short-term debt that converts into equity during a future funding round. As a Pre-Seed investor, 
          you receive Convertible Notes that will convert to equity shares at the Seed Round with a 15% discount. For example, if you invest 
          â‚¬1,000 in the Pre-Seed round, you'll receive â‚¬1,150 worth of shares after company valuation in the Seed Round.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are pro-rata rights?</h3>
        <p>
          Pre-Seed investors have the right to maintain their ownership percentage in future funding rounds. This means you'll have the first 
          opportunity to purchase additional shares equal to your percentage of pre-seed capital before other investors can participate.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the Angor protocol?</h3>
        <p>
          Angor is a P2P funding protocol built on Bitcoin that enables transparent milestone-based funding. 
          It ensures funds are released only when development milestones are reached and verified.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens after the Pre-Seed round?</h3>
        <p>
          After the 3-month development period, we'll announce our Seed Round, at which point your Convertible Notes will convert to equity shares 
          with a 15% discount based on the company's valuation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are the minimum and maximum investment amounts?</h3>
        <p>
          The maximum investment on Angor is currently 0.1 BTC (approximately $8,500) for each investor.
          However, we can accept larger investments through direct negotiation. 
          There is no minimum investment in the Pre-Seed round.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How will I receive investment updates?</h3>
        <p>
          All investors receive monthly progress reports. Angel tier ($5,000+) and Partner tier ($10,000+) 
          investors also get access to quarterly investor calls with the founding team.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>When do my Convertible Notes convert to equity?</h3>
        <p>
          Your Convertible Notes will convert to equity shares when we complete our Seed Round funding and establish a company valuation, 
          expected 3-6 months after the completion of Pre-Seed development.
