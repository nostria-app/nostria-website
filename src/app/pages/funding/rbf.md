### 1. Definitions
1.1 **"Gross Revenue"** means all revenue received by the Company from the Nostria app, including fiat subscriptions (net of Apple/Google commissions, typically 15–30%, and applicable VAT/sales taxes) and Bitcoin Lightning payments (valued in EUR at the time of receipt per Montenegro tax rules).  
1.2 **"Net Revenue"** means Gross Revenue minus applicable Montenegro taxes (9% corporate income tax and other applicable taxes).  
1.3 **"Revenue Share Percentage"** means 0.0001% of Net Revenue per NOS token held by the Investor, payable monthly, as distributed by OpenResist per the Company’s agreement with OpenResist.  
1.4 **"Financing Amount"** means the sum paid by the Investor to purchase NOS tokens at €4 per token via Bitcoin or Bitcoin Lightning, valued in EUR at the time of purchase per Bitstamp BTC/EUR rate.  
1.5 **"NOS Tokens"** means RGB tokens issued by OpenResist on the Bitcoin blockchain, with a total issuance of 1,000,000 tokens, each priced at €4 and representing 0.0001% of Net Revenue, not equity or ownership in Librevore DOO or OpenResist.  
1.6 **"OpenResist"** means a non-profit foundation supporting free speech software, responsible for issuing NOS tokens, receiving Net Revenue on the same terms as other Investors, and using such funds to pay for infrastructure (including hosting) and developers for Nostria apps and services.  
1.7 **"Payment Term"** means the period from the Effective Date continuing indefinitely until the Agreement is terminated per Section 7.

### 2. Financing and Revenue Share
2.1 **Financing**: The Investor becomes an Investor by purchasing NOS tokens at €4 each via Bitcoin or Bitcoin Lightning payment on the Bitcoin RGB protocol to [Insert Bitcoin Address or Lightning Address], valued in EUR per Bitstamp BTC/EUR rate at the time of purchase.  
2.2 **NOS Token Issuance**: In consideration of the Financing Amount, OpenResist shall issue the purchased number of NOS tokens to the Investor’s Bitcoin address [Insert Address], with each token representing 0.0001% of Net Revenue. A total of 1,000,000 NOS tokens shall be issued by OpenResist.  
2.3 **Revenue Share**: The Company shall transfer Net Revenue to OpenResist per their agreement, and OpenResist shall pay the Investor 0.0001% of Net Revenue per NOS token held monthly, starting [Insert Start Date, e.g., first month after App launch], continuing indefinitely, proportional to the Investor’s NOS token holdings relative to the total 1,000,000 tokens, unless terminated per Section 7. OpenResist shall receive Net Revenue on the same terms as other Investors to fund Nostria app infrastructure and development.  
2.4 **Payment Method**: Payments shall be made by OpenResist via:  
   (a) Bank transfer to [Insert Investor Bank Details]; or  
   (b) Bitcoin Lightning to [Insert Investor Lightning Address], valued in EUR at the time of payment per Bitstamp BTC/EUR rate. Payments shall not be facilitated through NOS tokens, which serve solely to represent revenue-sharing rights.  
2.5 **Reporting**: The Company shall provide monthly revenue reports to OpenResist and Investors within 10 days of month-end, including Gross Revenue, Net Revenue calculations, OpenResist revenue share (as an Investor), and proof (e.g., App Store/Google Play reports, Lightning transaction logs).  

---

### 3. Tax Compliance
3.1 **Montenegro Taxes**: The Company shall pay 9% corporate income tax and other applicable taxes (e.g., VAT) on Gross Revenue, per Montenegro’s tax laws, before calculating Net Revenue. The Investor is responsible for reporting their Revenue Share as income in their tax jurisdiction.  
3.2 **Crypto Taxes**: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Lightning payments (including Financing Amount and Revenue Share) are valued in EUR at receipt. The Company and/or OpenResist shall report gains (9% tax) and provide the Investor with transaction records for their tax filings. NOS tokens, used solely for representation, incur no tax until revenue is paid.

---

### 4. Non-Equity Arrangement
4.1 NOS tokens and this Agreement do not grant the Investor any equity, ownership, or voting rights in Librevore DOO, OpenResist, or the Nostria apps and services. The Revenue Share is a contractual profit-sharing arrangement, not a security under Montenegro’s Law on Securities or EU MiFID II.  
4.2 The Investor acknowledges they have no control over the Company’s operations, App hosting, revenue generation, or OpenResist’s activities.

---

### 5. Use of Funds
5.1 The Company shall use the Financing Amount for Nostria app hosting, marketing, and operational expenses, including transferring funds to OpenResist for infrastructure (including hosting) and developer payments.  
5.2 The Company shall maintain records of fund use, available for Investor review upon reasonable request.

---

### 6. Representations and Warranties
6.1 **Company**: Librevore DOO is duly registered in Montenegro, compliant with tax and AML laws. The Nostria app complies with Apple/Google policies and Montenegro regulations. NOS tokens, issued by OpenResist, are utility tokens for Revenue Share representation, not securities.  
6.2 **OpenResist**: OpenResist is a non-profit foundation compliant with applicable laws, responsible for issuing 1,000,000 NOS tokens and using its Revenue Share to pay for infrastructure and developers.  
6.3 **Investor**: The Investor has the legal capacity to enter this Agreement by purchasing NOS tokens, holds a compatible Bitcoin wallet for NOS tokens, and understands the risks of revenue-based financing, including potential non-repayment if the Nostria app generates insufficient Net Revenue.

---

### 7. Termination
7.1 **Exit Clause**: The Company may terminate this Agreement for an Investor if their cumulative Revenue Share payments per NOS token exceed the Exit Threshold (4 times the original issuance price of €4 per token, i.e., €16 per token). Upon termination, the Company may, at its discretion, negotiate new agreements with the Investor. The Company shall provide 30 days’ written notice of termination, and NOS tokens shall no longer entitle the Investor to payments unless a new agreement is executed.  
7.2 **Default**: Either party may terminate if the other breaches material terms (e.g., non-payment, fraud) and fails to cure within 30 days of notice.  
7.3 **Insolvency**: The Agreement terminates if the Company or OpenResist becomes insolvent or ceases Nostria app operations.  
7.4 **Effect of Termination**: Upon termination, the Company’s and OpenResist’s obligation to pay the Revenue Share ceases, except for amounts accrued prior to termination. NOS tokens shall no longer entitle the Investor to payments, unless a new agreement is made under Section 7.1.
