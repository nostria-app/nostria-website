**This Revenue-Based Financing Agreement** ("Agreement") is entered into on **October 1, 2025** ("Effective Date") by and between:

**Operating Entity / Coordinators**: Individuals and contributors coordinating the development and distribution of the Nostria application and related infrastructure (collectively "Nostria Coordinators"). No single incorporated entity is issuing equity under this Agreement.

**OpenResist Foundation**: A non-profit foundation supporting free speech software and decentralised communication infrastructure ("OpenResist").

**Investors**: Natural or legal persons who contribute Bitcoin via the Angor platform/protocol to the Nostria Seed Revenue-Based Financing raise and whose contribution is recorded in their Angor investor wallet ("Investors").

**Recitals**  
WHEREAS, Nostria is a distributed project (not a traditional equity corporation) providing subscription-based premium functionality and infrastructure for users of the Nostr protocol;  
WHEREAS, the Seed Revenue-Based Financing raise targets **USD $370,000** in additional capital (following an initial **USD $30,000 pre-seed** already contributed);  
WHEREAS, Pre-Seed contributors receive a **1.15x weighting multiplier** applied to their contributed principal when calculating revenue distribution shares;  
WHEREAS, Investors receive no equity or token issuance; instead, they obtain a contractual right to receive a share of premium subscription revenue;  
WHEREAS, 50% of Net Revenue from Nostria premium subscriptions will be allocated to the Investor Pool (pro‑rata by weighted contribution) and 50% to the OpenResist Foundation to fund infrastructure and continued development;  
WHEREAS, the Angor platform records contributions and facilitates distribution to Investors’ Angor wallets in Bitcoin (or Lightning-settled Bitcoin);  
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

---

### 1. Definitions
1.1 **"Gross Revenue"** means all revenue derived from Nostria premium subscription sales (after platform commission deductions from Apple App Store / Google Play and inclusive of equivalent revenue collected directly via Bitcoin / Lightning), valued in USD (or converted to USD at the time of receipt using a reputable BTC/USD index rate).  
1.2 **"Net Revenue"** means Gross Revenue minus applicable sales taxes, VAT/GST, and any legally mandated consumption or platform taxes. (No corporate profit tax is considered for allocation; this Agreement allocates pre‑tax distributable Net Revenue after transactional/platform charges and indirect taxes.)  
1.3 **"Weighted Contribution"** means each Investor’s contributed principal in USD equivalent, multiplied by 1.15 if (and only if) that principal (or a portion thereof) was part of the initial Pre-Seed $30,000 tranche; later Seed contributions are weighted at 1.00.  
1.4 **"Total Weighted Capital"** means the sum of all Investors’ Weighted Contributions.  
1.5 **"Investor Pool"** means 50% of Net Revenue allocated for distribution to Investors pro‑rata by their Percentage Share.  
1.6 **"Percentage Share"** means an Investor’s Weighted Contribution divided by Total Weighted Capital.  
1.7 **"Distribution"** means a periodic (intended monthly) transfer of each Investor’s share of the Investor Pool to their Angor investor wallet, settled in Bitcoin (on-chain or Lightning) based on BTC/USD rate at time of distribution.  
1.8 **"Angor Platform"** means the decentralized / platform service used to register contributions and automate (or facilitate) Distribution.  
1.9 **"Payment Term"** means the period beginning at first premium revenue generation and continuing unless terminated under Section 7.  
1.10 **"Termination Events"** means those events described in Section 7 that end future Distributions.  
1.11 **"OpenResist Allocation"** means the 50% of Net Revenue allocated to OpenResist for infrastructure, operations, and development funding.  
1.12 **"Pre-Seed Multiplier"** means the 1.15 factor applied to the initial $30,000 contributions only (not to later capital).
1.13 **"Original Contributed Principal"** means the nominal USD-equivalent principal amount an Investor contributed (before any weighting multiplier).
1.14 **"4× Review Threshold"** means the point at which an individual Investor's cumulative Distributions received under this Agreement equal four (4) times that Investor's Original Contributed Principal.

### 2. Financing and Revenue Share
2.1 **Raise Structure**: Investors contribute Bitcoin toward a target Seed raise of **USD $370,000** on Angor. An earlier **USD $30,000 Pre-Seed** has been completed and is granted the Pre-Seed Multiplier.  
2.2 **No Tokens / No Equity**: No tokens, shares, SAFEs, warrants, or other securities are issued. Investor rights are purely contractual revenue participation rights under this Agreement.  
2.3 **Weighted Allocation Formula**:  
   Percentage Share (for each Investor) = (Weighted Contribution) / (Total Weighted Capital).  
2.4 **Revenue Split**: Each Distribution period, 50% of Net Revenue becomes the Investor Pool; 50% becomes the OpenResist Allocation.  
2.5 **Distribution Mechanics**: Distributions are intended monthly (or at a practicable interval) and paid to the Investor’s Angor wallet in Bitcoin (on-chain or Lightning). Conversion from USD reference amounts to BTC uses a reputable BTC/USD index rate at the time of payment batch creation.  
2.6 **Reporting**: A revenue report will be published to Investors within 10 days of month-end detailing: Gross Revenue, Net Revenue calculation, total Investor Pool amount, each Investor’s Percentage Share, and BTC distribution transaction references.  
2.7 **Adjustments**: If a reporting or calculation error is discovered, corrections are applied in the next Distribution cycle. De minimis rounding differences may accumulate and be reconciled quarterly.

---

### 3. Tax Compliance
3.1 **Investor Responsibility**: Investors are solely responsible for any tax reporting or liabilities arising from receipt of Distributions in their jurisdiction.  
3.2 **Indirect Taxes**: Platform (App Store / Play) marketplace taxes and VAT/GST are deducted before Net Revenue is determined.  
3.3 **No Equity / Security Treatment**: This Agreement is intended as a commercial revenue-sharing contract and not an issuance of securities. Each Investor represents they understand the regulatory posture and accept associated risks.  
3.4 **Records**: Distribution statements and transaction IDs will be retained and made available to Investors for their accounting.

---

### 4. Non-Equity & Non-Token Arrangement
4.1 No equity, governance, or token-based ownership rights are granted. Investors have no voting or management authority.  
4.2 Investors acknowledge Nostria is a distributed collaboration. Operational decisions remain with contributors and OpenResist for infrastructure allocation.  
4.3 No promise of liquidity or resale market exists for revenue rights.

---

### 5. Use of Funds
5.1 Funds will be used for: infrastructure (relays, media storage, delivery), security, premium feature development, UX, moderation tooling, and community growth.  
5.2 A high-level allocation summary may be published periodically; granular line-item auditing is not guaranteed but good-faith transparency is intended.  
5.3 OpenResist may deploy funds to third-party service providers and contributors.

---

### 6. Representations and Warranties
6.1 **Nostria Coordinators / OpenResist**: Represent that they will make commercially reasonable efforts to operate, maintain, or evolve the premium subscription offering but provide no uptime or revenue guarantees.  
6.2 **Investors**: Represent that (a) they are contributing risk capital they can afford to lose, (b) they understand this is not equity, not debt, and not a security; (c) they have conducted their own diligence; (d) they will comply with applicable laws.  
6.3 **Regulatory**: Parties intend this Agreement to be a contractual revenue share; if a regulator requires changes, parties will negotiate in good faith to amend terms to maintain intent.

---

### 7. Term & Termination
7.1 **Duration**: This Agreement has no fixed end date; Distributions continue while premium revenue is generated and Section 7.2 events have not occurred.  
7.2 **Termination Events**: (a) Permanent discontinuation of the Nostria premium offering; (b) Regulatory prohibition of revenue distribution; (c) Mutually agreed restructuring; (d) Fraud or willful misconduct leading to investor vote (informal, non-binding coordination) to cease distributions; (e) Insolvency of coordinating operational capacity.  
7.3 **Effect**: Upon termination, future Distributions cease. Amounts accrued but unpaid prior to termination will be processed if practicable.  
7.4 **Amendment for Compliance**: If legal constraints arise, the parties may amend solely to achieve compliance while preserving economic intent.
7.5 **4× Review (Non-Terminating)**: Hitting the 4× Review Threshold does not terminate this Agreement nor suspend Distributions. It triggers a good‑faith, non-binding review window (up to 30 days) during which OpenResist and Investors may consider: (a) continuing unchanged; (b) adjusting the Investor Pool percentage; (c) converting to an alternate long‑term participation structure. No change takes effect without an Amendment under Section 10.2. If consensus is not reached, original terms persist.

---

### 8. Confidentiality
8.1 Non-public operational details, internal discussion logs, and unpublished financial summaries should be treated as confidential unless already public.  
8.2 Aggregate revenue figures, high-level roadmap, and distribution summaries may be publicly shared at OpenResist’s discretion.  
8.3 Compliance disclosures required by law or regulation are permitted.

---

### 9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
9.1 **Governing Law**: Chosen law to be determined based on primary coordination jurisdiction (to be finalized; placeholder: Laws of Montenegro) unless superseded by mandatory consumer/investor protection statutes in an Investor’s jurisdiction.  
9.2 **Arbitration**: Disputes not resolved informally within 45 days shall be submitted to binding arbitration (venue to be confirmed) with a single neutral arbitrator; costs shared unless award dictates otherwise.  
9.3 **Injunctive Relief**: Interim injunctive relief may be sought in a competent court to prevent misuse of funds or confidential material.

---

### 10. Miscellaneous
10.1 **Entire Agreement**: This document supersedes all prior token, SAFE, or equity-related expectations previously communicated.  
10.2 **Amendments**: May be adopted upon 60% (by Weighted Contribution) informal Investor consent and assent by OpenResist.  
10.3 **Assignment**: Revenue rights are non-transferable without written consent; no secondary market representation is permitted.  
10.4 **Notices**: Electronic notices via registered Angor communication channel or designated email constitute valid notice.  
10.5 **Severability**: Invalid provisions will be modified minimally to remain enforceable.  
10.6 **No Partnership**: Nothing herein forms a legal partnership, joint venture, or agency.

---

**ACCEPTANCE**  
By contributing capital via the Angor platform to the Nostria Seed Revenue-Based Financing raise, an Investor acknowledges and agrees to the terms of this Agreement (as may be updated per Section 10.2).
